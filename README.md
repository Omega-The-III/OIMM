# OIMM

OIMM is a procedurally generated VRChat world in the style of low poly retro voxels.

VRChat is a public social VR platform where most users are allowed to upload Unity3D scenes (also known as worlds) and avatars to use on their platform.

The aim of the OIMM project is to create a performant and networkable procedurally generated Mansion created from dynamic components.
OIMM will generate a mansion through connecting several components such as hallways and different types of rooms by linking their entrances/doors. Thus a chain of rooms is created.

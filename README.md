# OIMM

OIMM is a procedurally generated VRChat world in the style of victorian era low poly pixel art.

VRChat is a public social VR platform where most users are allowed to upload Unity3D scenes (also known as worlds) and avatars to use on their platform.

The aim of the OIMM project is to create a performant and networkable procedurally generated Mansion created from dynamic components.
OIMM will generate a mansion through connecting several components such as hallways and different types of rooms by linking their entrances/doors. 
Thus a chain of ever expanding rooms is created.

## Minimum requirements / Goals
 - Atleast 3 floors. Main, second and basement (players should be teleported in between through stairwell rooms)
 - The following rooms in the main layer
  - Study
  - Dining hall
  - living room
  - Hallway
 - Various sets of furniture
 - networkable (ensure late joiners can see the same mansion if possible)
 - performant (only a few rooms should be loaded at once)
